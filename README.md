This is the React Form trial project.
It was setup with [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript)

## Aim
Built a responsive form. The form includes a Name, EMail and Message field.
The labels are next to the inputs on a big screen and above on a small screen (<= 600px).

When the user submits the form, sending of the data is simulated with a timeout. While sending a loading indicator is shown and inputs are not be accessible.

You are totally free in deciding how you build this. If anything is unclear to you, just make an assumption and proceed with what you think makes sense.
